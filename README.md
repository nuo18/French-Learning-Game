# French-Learning-Game
I created it as my solution to my client's internal assessment when I was doing my IB diploma.

This learning application was created using tkinter and several other Python libraries. For my translator, I have used the free GoogleTrans APIs.

For information will be added soon.

To run the file, just open the FrenchLearn.exe file.
